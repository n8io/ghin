This TypeScript library provides a convenient and easy-to-use API wrapper for accessing the Golfer Handicap Index Network (GHIN) api unofficially. It allows you to interact with GHIN data, retrieve golfer handicaps, scores, and perform various operations related to golf handicaps.

## Features

- Retrieve golfer handicap information.
- Calculate course handicaps for golfers.
- Search for golfers by name, ID, or other criteria.
- Access golfer scoring history.
- And more!

## Installation

To use this library in your TypeScript project, you can install it via npm:

```shell
npm install ghin
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use this library:

```typescript
import GhinClient from 'ghin';

// Initialize the client
const ghin = new GhinClient({
  password: process.env.PASSWORD,
  username: process.env.USERNAME,
});

// Get a golfer's handicap
const ghinNumber = '1234567';
const { handicap_index } = await ghin.handicaps.getOne(ghinNumber);

console.log(`Golfer ${ghinNumber} has a handicap of ${handicap_index}`);
```
